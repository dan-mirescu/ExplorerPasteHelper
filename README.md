# ExplorerPasteHelper
A tool to auto-convert text file paths from the clipboard into items that can be pasted in the Windows Explorer

# Main use case
The Windows Photos app started to no longer make available as Paste option in Windows Explorer photos that are copied with CTRL + C.
I created this small tool so that I can still quickly copy files from the Windows Photos app and paste them in Windows Explorer.

Steps to use:

1. Open the ExplorerPasteHelper app and keep it open
2. In Windows photos app, press CTRL + SHIFT + C to copy the photo file path to the clipboard. ExplorerPasteHelper will automatically make it available as a paste option in Windows Explorer.
3. Paste the photo in Explorer.

# Download
Download the application from under the Releases section on Github.
